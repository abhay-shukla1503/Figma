                    Computer science and technology have undergone unprecedented advancements, revolutionizing the world as we know it and shaping our
                    future in unimaginable ways.One of the most exciting areas of development is artificial intelligence (AI). With the increasing 
                    availability of data and computational power, AI has surged forward, enabling machines to learn,reason, and make decisions like 
                    never before. AI is already being used in various domains, including healthcare, finance,transportation, and entertainment. 
                    It has the potential to optimize processes, enhance productivity, and improve decision-making across industries.The emergence of 
                    the Internet of Things (IoT) has further connected the physical world with the digital realm.IoT devices, ranging from smart home 
                    gadgets to industrial sensors, have created a network of interconnected devices capable of exchanging data and insights. This 
                    interconnectedness has ushered in an era of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and personalized consumer experiences, improving 
                    efficiency, sustainability, and convenience.Blockchain technology has also left a profound impact on various sectors, most notably 
                    finance. Its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature has disrupted traditional financial systems,enabling secure and transparent 
                    peer-to-peer transactions. Beyond finance, blockchain has the potential to revolutionize supply chain management, voting systems, 
                    and identity verification, among other applications.Computer science has significantly influenced the entertainment industry as 
                    well.

            <p id="lower">Today’s generation cannot imagine life without programmes, software, apps, and websites. One of the major reasons behind technological 
                development and digitalization of the modern age lies in lines of codes. If you are new to the world of Programming or Coding, then the Coding 
                lines would appear like some type of a puzzle. If you wonder what exactly is a Computer code, or are perplexed by the Computer programmes, then 
                this is just for you. 
                Computer Programming or Coding involves the process where you give instructions to Computers with the help of Programming languages 
                that the machines understand. The Computer programme is the sequence of instructions that can range between a two-line code to something 
                that can run into millions of lines. The Computer programs are written for specifying individual tasks to the Computer. There are various 
                software programs and related technologies that we interact with on a daily basis. The Computer program is the foundation of most of these 
                technologies and forms the core of their functioning.
                If you are someone who loves electronic gadgets or Computers then you must be familiar with the meaning of Coding. The chances are you have 
                already heard about the terms Programming and Coding various times. Computers are electronic devices which are made using transistors. The 
                Computer doesn’t understand human language, and thus they are made of transistors which only understand the binary instructions, which is on 
                or off and it is represented by the 0s and 1s.Some of the major Coding languages that are used and deployed in modern applications include 
                Java, C, C++, Python, PHP, C#, Perl, and Ruby. These Programming languages have their own structures and protocols that make them distinct 
                from each other. These languages have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages as well.</p>
